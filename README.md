# #NoEstimates - Or Forecasting with Data
The purpose of this repository is to look at some alternatives to forecast work progress without the need to estimate. 

## My Definition of #NoEstimates

> __TLDR;__ My Definition of '#NoEstimates' - reduce estimation to a minimum and use previous data (cycle times, etc.) to forecast remaining work.

I see the _#NoX_ movement as less of _X_ in a lean thinking way. When we use a lean mindset we try to reduce waste. For example, waste are activities or things which are not directly adding value to the customer. Of course, we will not get rid of all the waste but we try to eliminate it to a bare minimum.  It's like the daily standup. A standup is technically waste, but useful for the team. But you would not say that we should do standups twice a day, because they are useful? So, it's a thin line between waste we need and waste we don't want. Be pragmatic, not dogmatic! 

I personally want to __reduce estimation to a minimum and use previous data (cycle times, etc.) to forecast__ were we stand and when we might be done.

## Examples
This repository is collection of approaches to do work estimation with data.
- [Forecasting with a Monte Carlo Simulation (Juyper Notebook)](notebooks/forecasting_with_monte_carlo.ipynb)

The examples are inspired from previous publications form _Klaus Leopold, Vasco Duarte and Daniel S. Vacanti_. For more details have look at the reference section.
