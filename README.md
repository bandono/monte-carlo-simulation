# Monte Carlo Simulation for Cycle Times

I saw some example and plugins (see references) for estimating the cycle times in a kanban system. 
So I decided to do the same thing with a Python Jupyter Notebook. 

- Forecasting with a Monte Carlo Simulation ([Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/forecasting_with_monte_carlo.ipynb))
